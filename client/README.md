# 32 Beads Board Game 🎲
## Introduction 📖

32 Beads is an ancient board game played in the eastern part of Bharat (India). This project is a web-based implementation of the game, built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The game is hosted on Vercel, and the server is hosted on Render.com.

## About the Game 🕹️

32 Beads is a two-player strategy board game. Each player has 16 beads. The objective of the game is to eliminate all of your opponent's beads.

## How to Play 🎮

- Two players can play live together online.
- Each player takes turns placing a bead on any hole on the board.
- A player can eliminate an opponent's bead if their bead is next to the opponent's bead and the spot beyond the opponent's bead (in a straight line or diagonally) is empty. The opponent's bead is then removed from the board.
- The first player to eliminate all of their opponent's beads wins.

(Note: An AI opponent feature is currently under development.)
